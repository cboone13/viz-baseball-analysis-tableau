# 🏟️ Swing Stats: Visualizing Baseball Performance by Handedness (Tableau)

**Project Type:** Data Visualization / Exploratory Storytelling  
**Tools:** Tableau  
**Dataset:** Baseball Player Stats (1,157 players categorized by batting handedness)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **Tableau** to explore how a baseball player's **batting handedness** — left, right, or both — may affect their performance. Through interactive visual storytelling, we analyze variables such as home runs, batting averages, height, and weight to uncover trends and patterns in performance.

The visualizations help address a central question:  
➡️ *Do left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous hitters show higher average performance metrics?*

## 🛠️ Design Summary

This project uses a mix of bar charts, donut charts, scatter plots, and story points to tell a cohesive and interactive story. Each visualization allows dynamic filtering based on handedness selection:

1. **Donut Chart**  
   Shows proportion of players by handedness.

2. **Bar Chart Comparison**  
   Compares group sizes across batting categories.

3. **Height vs. Weight Scatter Plot**  
   Visualizes body metrics and correlation with average lines for reference.

4. **Home Runs vs. Batting Average**  
   Highlights correlation within handedness groups with dynamic average lines.

5. **Batting Average by Player Height**  
   Identifies possible trends between height and batting effectiveness.

6. **Cross-Chart Comparison**  
   Compares group performance across height for deeper insights.

7. **Conclusion Slides**  
   Breaks out each group for side-by-side comparison, with aligned axes for fair evaluation.

## 🧠 Key Insight

🔍 **Initial Findings:**  
Left-handed hitters showed marginally better average performance compared to right- and both-handed hitters.

## 📝 Feedback & Iteration

### 🔁 Feedback Implemented:

1. **Small storyline font**  
   → Increased font size and added bold styling.

2. **Story box size hiding content**  
   → Adjusted graph heights and increased point spacing.

3. **Low-contrast color legend**  
   → Resolved filtering state to display all groups by default.

4. **Misaligned conclusions**  
   → Verified and corrected conclusion statements to match visual evidence.
